Statistical learning - the extraction of regularities from experience - is a fundamental function of the episodic memory system that supports prediction and memory-guided behavior. In adults, hippocampus supports statistical learning by linking (integrating) experiences which regularly co-occur in time, representing them with more similar activity patterns. Although neuroimaging work suggests that the hippocampus is also engaged during statistical learning in infants, behavioral evidence indicates that the ability to learn temporal regularities improves significantly across childhood and adolescence. Critically, little is known about how neural representations of statistical structure change across development, or how such representational differences relate to memory behavior. This study examined developmental differences in the neural representation of temporal regularities in children (7–9 years), early adolescents (10–12 years), and adults during a statistical learning task. 

Participants viewed implicitly structured sequences while undergoing fMRI and were later tested on memory for statistical regularities. Representational similarity during item presentations before and after learning provided direct measures of learning-related representational change. We identified three primary mechanisms underlying developmental gains in statistical learning: 1) representational scale, reflecting integration across broader temporal windows, 2) representational symmetry, reflecting bidirectional linking of sequences in forward and backward time, and 3) transition sensitivity, reflecting neural tracking of transitional probabilities and associated hippocampal–cortical interactions. We demonstrate that children show more local, forward-only representations consistent with earlier-maturing posterior hippocampal function, whereas adolescents and adults exhibit broader, bidirectional representations supported by anterior hippocampus and hippocampal–prefrontal coupling. By jointly characterizing representational scale, symmetry, and transition sensitivity across age groups, this study provides a mechanistic account of how neural representations of temporal structure develop and how these changes support continued improvements in statistical learning into adulthood.
